You belived in
fabulous monsters
and let them guide you
one shadow at a time
hunting them through the ruins
and the jungles we'd abandoned
dark overgrown paths
that brought you back to us
you'd changed your spots
for scars we couldn't see
and longed to show us
You walked with us again
but left no tracks
that we could follow
